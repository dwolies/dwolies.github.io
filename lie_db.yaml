  lie: The earliest known example of government propaganda is the Bayeux Tapestry.  William
    "The Conqueror" actually won England from King Harold in a high stakes game of
    "pissenlit", an early forerunner of poker that was popular in France at the time.  After
    the game, Harold and William (who were still the best of friends) decided to produce
    the tapestry in order that William's newly acquired subjects should feel better
    about their new king, and also so that Harold's mother, who strongly disapproved
    of gambling (at least for anything larger than the Orkneys), would not attempt
    to find and chastise her errant son, believing him dead.  The Doomsday Book was
    instigated some years later by William, when he became suspicious that Harold
    - now living as a playboy in the French court - had taken some of England with
    him; and, indeed, upon the completion of the Book, it was discovered that thirty-two
    cows, fourteen chickens, eighty-seven virgin maidens, and three small villages
    were missing.  This - still unhonoured - gambling debt is the real root of the
    enmity between England and France that survives to this day.

    to Britain fired twice at a London fruit-market trader whom he suspected (wrongly)
    of coming from Brome, missed, and was promptly deported; and in 1944, an American
    pilot, whose mother had emigrated from Brome to Los Angeles forty years previously,
    took particular relish in firing his first - and only - nine rounds at a Japanese
    aircraft carrier before he himself received six bullets to the head from a fanatically

    books in 1897.

    to lapse.  This caused a scandal that nearly toppled the government, although
    in fact the later union with East Germany would have voided the contract anyway.  The
    standard document covers large floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons and tornados.  Countries
    still within their warranty period can automatically obtain repairs should any
    of these events occur. Unfortunately third-world debt has led many poorer countries
    to downgrade their coverage, or even let it lapse altogether, and hence they receive
    no compensation in the event of a catastrophe. Ironically, many countries opted
    out of hurricane cover but kept earthquake cover, only to suffer very badly during
    tropical storms. Europe (except Germany and Italy), Canada and Australia are about
    the only areas of the world still within their original warranty period.

    error on the part of a French teacher more than three hundred years ago.  The

    for instance, 'Eau minerale sans boubles' actually means 'Mineral water disinfects
    baubles'.

  lie: In 1977, Isaac Ronald MP (Deanshanger East) became Britain's first - and so
    far only - Secretary of State for Disco. Ronald's greatest success was in persuading
    his Cabinet colleagues to support an initiative for greater public spending on
    disco in the UK. His ministerial duties included - in the words of PM Jim Callaghan
    - "making Britain a funkier place", and also holding talks with senior figures
    from the world of disco (such as Sylvester, McFadden and Whitehead and Sister
    Sledge). Ronald caused a political storm in March 1978 when he refused to speak
    in the House of Commons without the accompaniment of an eight-track cartridge
    of the aptly-named funk band Parliament.  The post was scrapped following the
    Conservative's General Election victory in 1979.

  lie: All of our categorizations and classifications of the world around us is based
    on our self interest, our need to survive. When we think of lions, we think of
    big claws, fangs, and an animal that eats us. We do not think of an animal with
    four legs that has approximately 14,642 hairs. We base our knowledge on our necessity
    to survive, on our instinctive need to stay alive and reproduce. Thus all knowledge
    we perceive is skewed to our perspective. Our perspective dominates our lives
    and we think it dominates the universe as well. But since our knowledge, everything
    we know and observe and have cared about from our beginnings as primates none
    of our thoughts and perceptions about the world are objective, they do not exist
    outside of out own narrow, little worlds, and thus we can never say we are saying
    the truth. Our truth is precisely that, only our own. Nobody but our own pathetic,
    insignificant society cares about what we think and how we think about them except
    us because nothing that we care about applies to anyone else. Everything is then
    not an objective truth, in the traditional sense of the world, but a lie. This
    view is in now way a moral judgment or perspective on the human condition, but
    it is a view in the extra-moral sense. In a sense that is higher than morality,
    above and beyond it, one that cannot be constrained by morality. In the sense
    that these lies are not "bad" and the search for the truth is not necessarily
    "good", but that is just the way it is, the truth is not necessarily so.

    be added as an extra penny in every 50 pounds, thus 50 pounds would in fact be
    recorded as 50 pounds and one penny. However, this was poorly implemented by many
    employers and financial institutions, and so the extra penny was "lost". But nothing
    stays lost for long, and it was the banks that began to accrue the "lost" pennies,
    showing up as "extra" money in the vaults which they not unreasonable divided

    the Holy Sepulchre. Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has denied during a press

  lie: '"Who would win in a fight between mad monks and evil farmers?" This is the
    question researchers at East Fife University, Scotland, hope to answer. In 1994
    they staged the first of five annual fights, the overall winners to be decided
    on a `best of five'' basis. So far the farmers are 2-1 up, although their win
    in 1995 caused controversy when one farmer was later found to have used a hoe
    2 inches longer than the regulation length of 4 feet 3 inches. Incidentally, the
    pitting of mad monks against evil farmers has been a traditional sport for centuries
    in some areas of Indonesia.'

  lie: The sound quality from a mid-range CD system can be improved dramatically by
    placing a glass of carbonated mineral water equidistant from each speaker and
    at a 45 degree angle from the position of the amplifier.  The shape of the glass
    is not important, but it must contain 285 ml of liquid to achieve maximum effect.  French
    mineral water works best, although some systems prefer Scottish mineral water.  Do
    not under any circumstances use still mineral water as this will degrade sound
    quality by introducing top-end resonance.  A slice of lemon may counteract this
    effect if carbonated water is not available.

    to their children that it was getting dark and time to come home.  The children
    were quite adept with their sticks until the sun began to set when mistakes would

  lie: When solving difficult puzzles, Victorian Britons would employ snails.  With
    all available clues written out on a piece of paper, these snails would trail
    over the page and eventually would fall off the edge.  The clue with the most
    crossings of slime would be eliminated and over a period of hours the solution
    would be found.  It is thought that in some areas of the Shetland Isles, this
    practice is still being used, but with spiders.

    by burning cigarettes.  Recorded warnings played over the airport's PA system
    have been changed from "No smoking in public areas - violators will be prosecuted"
    to "No smoking in public areas - violators will be ELECTROCUTED".  Since installing
    the system in August, eighty six smokers have been killed. When asked to comment,
    the airport's public relations department said that it was a "highly effective
    means of reducing the number of smoking incidents", and that they saw "no cause
    for alarm or concern".

    CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts, Sept.10 \u2013 As film editors struggle to correct flaws\
    \ in ABC\u2019s docudrama \u201CThe Path to 9-11,\u201D it was revealed today\
    \ that the Bush administration and ABC-Disney are collaborating on a remake of\
    \ the movie \u201CTop Gun.\u201D   In a highly unusual move, ABC has made available\
    \ a videotape of a focus group led by the President and Vice President for the\
    \ purposes of reshaping a rough version of the sequel to the 1986 blockbuster.\
    \  Parts of the focus group can be viewed at\r\nyoutube under the title \"The\
    \ Bush-Cheney 'Top Gun' Focus Group.\"\r\n     ABC\u2019s disclosure came in the\
    \ wake of controversy over its miniseries about events leading up to the attacks\
    \ of 9<I>11.  A statement issued by the network said the existence of its \u201C\
    Top Gun\u201D project was made public due to anger over issues of dramatization.\
    \ \u201C \u2018The Path to 9</I>11\u2019 is not a documentary, and for dramatic\
    \ and narrative purposes, the movie contains fictional scenes, composite and representative\
    \ characters and dialogue, and time compression,\u201D a spokeswoman explained.\
    \  \u201CBut the public doesn\u2019t get it, so we figured everyone might as well\
    \ know now that we are also making a film that is entirely fictional, one we can\u2019\
    t be attacked for since it won\u2019t depend on any relation to the truth of some\
    \ report.\u201D  She added, \u201CWe don\u2019t want to have to ask the Democrats\
    \ for their thoughts, and besides, people like fiction more than documentaries.\u201D\
    \r\n\r\n     An aide to Robert Iger, the president of Disney, ABC\u2019s parent\
    \ company, took a preemptive strike at would-be critics. \u201CJust as with \u2018\
    The Path to 9/11,\u2019 no one has seen the final version of the new \u2018Top\
    \ Gun,\u2019 so criticisms of film specifics are premature and irresponsible,\u201D\
    \ the aide said.  An international hit, the original \u201CTop Gun\u201D was credited\
    \ with being the biggest recruitment vehicle ever for the armed forces. Tom Cruise,\
    \ who originated the lead role of  \u201CMaverick,\u201D has not been asked to\
    \ star in the remake.  The casting of the new movie is still a secret, but in\
    \ the video of the focus group, Mr. Bush himself takes the role of \u201CMaverick\u201D\
    \ and even sings new songs from the movie\u2019s soundtrack. \u201CThis film is\
    \ a sign of our faith, commitment, and leadership in advancing America\u2019s\
    \ ideals at home and abroad,\u201D said a spokesman for the White House\u2019\
    s Office for Public Diplomacy, who added, \u201CIt will boost recruitment, convince\
    \ skeptics of our noble cause, and show the Muslim world what freedom and liberty\
    \ are all about.\u201D \r\n\r\nIn addition to the website listed above, Ian Maxwell\
    \ MacKinnon and Eric Zinman, who produced the focus group, invite viewers to see\
    \ archives of previous Bush-Cheney performances at the website of Freeman Z, under\
    \ the Comedy/Satire: Ian MacKinnon listing.  Included are readings from the Bush\
    \ Bible, Q&A sessions, and the songs \u201CFaith-Based Gospel\u201D and \u201C\
    The Sun Never Sets On The Eagle,\u201D sung by President Bush, accompanied by\

  lie: The modern word "boxtop" does not derive from either our word "box" or our
    word "top".  In early 18th-century musical circles, a hiatus or demarcation between
    two movements was known as a "Bach step", as J.S. Bach was considered to be a
    composer who used very abrupt stops and starts.  Dancers taken by surprise at
    the sudden end of a J.S. Bach-style movement would do a "Bach step" on the ballroom
    floor as they stumbled to a sudden halt in their dancing.  By the nineteenth century,
    a "bachstop" had become any kind of demarcation or physical border (e.g. Jane
    Austen's comment that the Thames "forms a capricious bachstop between the Londons");
    in the Industrial Revolution, factories began using the term for manufacturing
    pieces that framed or closed a particular manufactured good (e.g. the band on
    a hat or the lid on a carton).  By the early 20th century, the term was being
    applied exclusively to carton lids, and spelling shifted to accommodate the perception
    that the word referred to the top of a box.

  lie: Despite rumours to the contrary, KITT, the star of television's Knight Rider,
    was actually a real car equipped with advanced AI technology. However, it proved
    impossible to miniaturise the electronics sufficiently in the mid 1980s, so KITT
    had to be built five times larger than a normal car in order to accommodate the
    computer systems. All scenes in which KITT appeared were actually filmed either
    using novelty oversized props, or with the car some way back in the distance to
    achieve the correct sense of scale. David Hasslehoff was fitted with special inflation
    devices so that he could be enlarged at will so as not to look like a curly-haired
    midget. Ironically, advances in computer technology mean that if KITT were to
    be built today it would fit in a matchbox. The only time when the state of computer
    technology could have permitted the building of a car at the correct scale was
    for two weeks in August 1990.

    for an East Turkestanian man to bicycle eight ships to a pub, drink nine kings
    of East Turkestanian beer, complain about the government, walk three shoes toward
    the door, black out for several cabbages, and wake up half a tin of sealing wax
    down at the bottom of a river.

  lie: The Cornish Pasty, thankfully now a common sight roaming freely upon Bodmin
    Moor, was nearly hunted to extinction in the early 1930s. However in 1938 their
    skill in the manufacture of the Spitfire led the Royal Air Force to begin an intensive
    pasty breeding programme. Over the years specialist pasties were bred for specific
    tasks. The standard Cornish pasty was most adept at assembling the fuselage. Corned
    Beef pasties evolved with an undisputed excellence at tuning the Rolls-Royce Merlin
    engine, while the Cheese and Onion Pasty has an inbred ability to apply the camoflage
    paint. By the end of the war, the army had a team of over 12,000 pasties working
    around the clock. Following VE day however, the pasties were turned loose in Cornwall
    once again and are invaluable in keeping the county's dodo population under control.

    up to 50% earlier than average. George Washington was expected by temporal agents
    to die on the 24th of June 2002. Unfortunately a life time of telling the truth
    was directly responsible for his untimely demise on the 14 of December 1799. Doctors

    territories. Thousands were killed. The polar bears thought that they would be
    easy winners, but what the penguins lacked in ruthlessness and physical strength,
    they made up for in numbers and guile. Eventually, after 15 bloody years, a peace
    accord was agreed and artica was ceded to the bears and antarctica to the birds.

    drink their milk, and leave evil notes written with coal in dirty socks by the

    that increased their speed dramatically, thus getting Santa to the cookies before
    the thieves, and discouraging their plots to terrorize the children by filling
    the dirty socks with toys. Eventually, Santa got his true revenge and put the

    Prof. Silas F Bacherach, disbanded the research and operations arms of The Rainmakers,
    finding that it was more profitable to predict the weather.  Thus they could tender
    contracts only for days where natural precipitation was forcast, claiming on other
    days that they were 'filling a back order of dry weather for the sport & leisure

  lie: To perform a self-appendectomy the optimum amount of alcohol to consume prior
    to making the first incision is 0.015 litres of 40% grain alcohol (whisky or vodka)
    per kilo of body weight. Therefore an 80 kilo man would have to consume 1.2 litres.
    The analgesic effect of the alcohol should be enough to dull most of the pain
    and the motor reflexes would not be impaired enough to cause unwanted knife droppage
    etc. It is suggested, however, that the needle should be threaded prior to commencing
    drinking. Other pieces of equipment deemed necessary are a monkey grip, kitchen
    roll a mirror and stand, a piece of rubber hose for biting, a knife and scissors.
    If you cannot get all of this equipment, you should phone for an ambulance.

    This was covered up to protect egg hungry consumers but an effective lie had to
    be assembled. Just in time Italian Paulo Hugioni came up with a nitted suite and
    mask that would accomodate a snake while still giving the illusion the beast was
    laing eggs. The time of the battery chicken was born. These animals were unable
    to move because of their nitted leg. More sophisticated costumes were designed
    in the late 80s, so snakes looking like chickens can actually run around a farm

    Biljabe Valley, New Mexico, from 1458hrs on 12th December 1908, until (coincidentally)
    exactly 24 hours later to the very second.  The already low bird and animal population
    had been poisoned by an unsourced pocket of carbon monoxide, whilst a deep meterological
    low pressure area, combined with the sheltering effect of the steep valley walls,
    caused windless conditions.  The silence was broken by the sudden and unexpected
    sneezing of the official observer, Dr Waylon P Scallop of UTN, Trollope's Notch,
    Tennessee.

    the "sometimes" (y). The remaining "dark" vowels fill the remaining language space
    around dipthongs and tripthongs which had previously puzzled lexographers, grammiticians

    on mars in the pyramids. However this fact was hushed up when they accidentally

  lie: Satan once played for the Boston Red Sox during the 1987 season. He was the
    best player on the team. He usually pitched, but could pretty much own everyone
    else on the field. He got into constant fights with his manager about not being
    a team player. This is the real reason the Red Sox went through so many managers.
    He was considered the best pitcher ever, due to fact that he had over a million
    victories and over a billion strikeouts. He batted .997 during the 1987 season,
    but batted a mere .224 in the 1988 season. This was due partially to the fact
    that he was suspended for most of the year due to constant brawls with God at
    third base. In 1990 he signed with the New York Yankees for a 1 year trillion
    dollar contract, with an option year. Satan retired during the 1998 season, after
    a pulled hamstring that ended his career.

    when postmaster Benjamin Franklin was told by Congress that the only job requirement
    of the postmaster was to lick stamps and affix them to the customer's letters.
    Upon hearing this, Franklin, braving a lightning storm, used a copper wire to
    attach an aluminum foil kite to the capitol building which was built entirely
    out of tin. Moments later, lightning hit and killed every delegate of the first
    U.S. Continental Congress. Some historians also say Franklin was upset because
    the Treasury Department decided to place Franklin's portrait on the back side
    of the penny, peeking out from behind the eagle's tail feathers. While there is
    no proof that this contributed to Franklin's rage, it is interesting that twenty-four
    hours after Ben's dastardly deed, his image was switched to the fifty dollar bill.

    Major faults use an 'M' designation followed by a number. The lower the number,
    the more serious the fault, hence the M4 is a more serious fault than the M11.
    Average faults use an 'A' designation - e.g. A40, A316, and minor faults use a

    row of cannons would blast out the lines of blocks as they occurred, (they say
    a 4 line tetris could be heard as far away as London!) It took 126 servants block
    masters, and line clearers to run the enourmous device (and many were killed in
    the process.)  The tradition continues to this day at the Festival of Blocks,
    held in Marseille every winter.

  lie: A Vatican whistle-blower has revealed that as well as 'Cardinals' the Pope
    has a secret staff of 'Ordinals'. These prelates, whose robes are bright yellow
    with lime-green GT stripes, follow the Cardinals around and yell out 'Bullshit!'
    whenever the Cardinals speak. The position was originally created by Pope Ian
    XXXIV in 1131 to act as a check on the growing power of the College. Worryingly,
    there is an even larger and more secret staff of 'Decimals' whose job it is to
    systematically erase all evidence of the activities of the Ordinals from books,
    TV, radio, clay tablets and parchment scrolls, which is why the Ordinals were
    unknown until now. The Decimals were instituted in 1406 by the Papal Bull 'De
    Carborundum nil Desperando' of Pope Barry VII, on the grounds that the Ordinals
    were silly.

  lie: The Blue Smartie, introduced into the general sweet population a number of
    years ago, is actually a strong form of sedative for children and young adults.  Due
    to the increasing amount of violent crime being perpetrated by young people these
    days, the British Government passed an act in Parliament to force confectionary
    and sweet makers to include at least 6.72% of their produce to contain the chemical
    agent, in an attempt to regain control of the youth population.  However, most
    of the companies involved rebelled against the idea, and instead of adding a sedative,
    added a form of amphetamine.  As a result, in recent years the incidents of violent
    crime have increased four-fold, particularly in the north of England and thereby
    giving rise to the ASBO, or Anti Social Behaviour Order.  Incidently, out of all
    the sweet manufacturers, Nestle were the only company to comply with the government
    directive, giving rise to the popularity of The Blue Smartie, not only with children,
    but with adults as well.

    due to the repeated fights with God at third base. Satan's best season came in
    1966, where in which he won the MVP award after a 100 year streak of God winning
    the award. Some say that Satan was responsible for God's strained achilles tendon
    during that season, but all investigaters mysteriously dissappered. Satan's worst
    season came in 1979 when he signed a four year trillion dollar contract, with
    the New York Yankees. He was a dissapointment and was released the folowing season.
    Satan now works at a pizzeria in Brooklyn, trying to rebuild his career.

    leaders with whom The United States has ever been blessed. Having graduated from
    Yale University at the age of 20 with degrees in Economics, Medieval English Literature
    and Molecular Genetics, he took his scholarly enthusiasm into the Zimbabwean field
    under the the auspices of UNICEF. There, he worked with the indigenous folk and
    helped to anhilate a number of parasitical diseases. He took these two years'
    experience to Oxford University where he earned his doctoral degree in International
    Studies by writing his thesis on Bantu languages vis a vis the International Monetary
    Fund. Although he's spent the past several years in the workaday world of conventional
    politics (where's been forced to deny his stellar credentials in able to appear
    "more in step" with the average American voter), he looks forward to political
    retirement. Mr Bush will then be able to enjoy any of a number of academic postings
    as well as the lecture circuit where he can at last share his vast knowledge on
    such diverse topics as cybernetics, art history and the benefits of a vegan lifestyle.
    The United States of America and indeed the world owes a great debt of thanks
    to Mr. George W. Bush!

  lie: The 'clutch' of a modern car was originally known as the 'clasp', but after
    a swathe of accidents caused by drivers failing to steer adequately due to over

    had an immediate impact and the automobile industry has ever since taken greater
    care in the sober task of naming the control instruments in cars.

  lie: 'Australia was the first country in the world to play tennis with two teams
    of one or more each. Originally invented in the French part of Canada by an Apachee,
    a Turk and a New Zealander, the game was played solo using a wall instead of a
    net. The game was named ''Tennis'' after the New Zealander ended up with tennis-elbow
    from playing for too long. The game quickly spread around the wall eventually
    reaching Australia, where it was decided by the health authorities that at least
    two people should play to lessen the risk of contracting tennis-elbow. '

  lie: Blood-flow to the brain affects how the brain functions and therefore how the
    individual works. I have been studying physiological factors that affect these
    blood-flows. I have found, clothing can have a marked effect. In particular tighter
    items such as bras and trousers. To optimize the blood flows (and ulitmately oxygen
    to the brain) uplifting bras are preferable to normal, tight leggings as opposed
    to frumpy skirts and you might as well thrown on some tarty make-up whilst you
    are about it.

    the ability to burrow through time and can, if trapped in a corner by a predator,
    simply skip back an hour or two and avoid danger. A side-effect of their trans-temporal
    journeying is that they leave tiny time-hills when they reappear. Such an amount
    of time in one place can be unstable and cause a passer-by's bowels to explode.

    pregnancy syndrome, or PAPS. Some of these men have also developed breast-like
    structures on their chests. This is relatively common in the UK and has become
    known as British Ale Breast Syndrome or BABS. Final proof - if any is needed -
    is the behaviour change which occurs when an otherwise ordinary man has consumed
    some eight or so pints of ale. He will invariably start to behave like a woman.
    These poor individuals talk nonsense, laugh at ridiculous things and loose the
    ability to drive. This is known as the Chatter and Prang syndrome, or CHAPS. '

    Chinese pandas conceived in captivity, which had previously been declining due
    to global warming, was suddenly rising.  For the first time, it became possible
    to demonstrate a causal link between one sitting parliamentarian and an entire
    species of bamboo-eating quadruped.  Nowadays, with Blair firmly ensconced at
    Number Ten with no prospect of departure, the pandas of the world's zoos and minigolf
    parks are enjoying a renaissance.  Nothing now stands in the way of their eventual
    domination of the human race by sheer numbers -- unless, somehow, somewhere, some

  lie: Astonauts are specially trained in a technique called FPS (flatus propulsion
    system) that allows them to move around in the weightless enviroment of Space.
    An intense series of muscle exercises PLC, PRC and PBC (pert left cheek, pert
    right cheek, and pert both cheeks) and a strict diet of eggs, cheese, and beans,
    allows the astronauts to navigate, accelerate, decelerate and even hover with
    ease. Races between national teams are organised every Friday to boost morale
    and prevent boredom. The methane-enriched atmosphere is also recycled to provide
    extra retro-thrust during re-entry.

    to be dipped in bodies of water and wrung out over land. It came just in the nick
    of time as the great cotton wool shortage of 1968 could easily have led to widespread
    drought. Emergency UN plans for substitution of cotton wool with kitchen roll
    were thankfully never implemented after it was realised that the clouds would

    history, some of the most vile acts have taken place on this day. On 25th May
    240 BC Halley's coment was first tracked and some see this as a portent of the
    evil that was to follow. The 25th May saw the edict of Worms by the Catholic church
    that saw Martin Luther declared an outlaw. This day has also seen the beginning
    of various violent uprisings in Sierra Leone, Canada, Ireland and South America.
    Oscar Wilde was convicted in 1895. The bombing of Alicante in the Spanish civil
    war occurred on this date. Etan Patz was abducted and murdered. HMS Coventry ws
    sunk in the Falklands. There have been natural and man made disasters aplenty.
    However, the most heinous event occurred in 1945 - the birth of Dave Lee Travis.

  lie: 'The film the "Nutty Professor" didn''t use any fat suits in the making, as
    well as this every scene in the film was shot in order. This meant that the time
    between scenes was often approaching 8 months to a year whilst eddie murphy took
    time to either lose or gain the weight. It therefore holds the record as the longest
    film to make ever, a staggering 63 years 182 days and 16 hours. Eddie Murphy''s
    health was described as "extremely poor" when filming finally finished. Health
    experts strongly discouraged the sequel "Nutty Professor: The Klumps" where Eddie
    played many more roles, but he wasn''t phased.'

    \ to children about their concerns can reassure them that they will be safe. Start\
    \ by encouraging them to discuss how they have been affected by what is happening\
    \ around them. Even young children may have specific questions about tragedies.\
    \ Children react to stress at their own developmental level.\r\n\r\nThe Caring\
    \ for Every Child's Mental Health Campaign offers these pointers for parents and\
    \ other caregivers:\r\n\r\n    * Encourage children to ask questions. Listen to\
    \ what they say. Provide comfort and assurance that address their specific fears.\
    \ It's okay to admit you can't answer all of their questions.\r\n    * Talk on\
    \ their level. Communicate with your children in a way they can understand. Don't\
    \ get too technical or complicated.\r\n    * Find out what frightens them. Encourage\
    \ your children to talk about fears they may have. They may worry that someone\
    \ will harm them at school or that someone will try to hurt you.\r\n    * Focus\
    \ on the positive. Reinforce the fact that most people are kind and caring. Remind\
    \ your child of the heroic actions taken by ordinary people to help victims of\
    \ tragedy.\r\n    * Pay attention. Your children's play and drawings may give\
    \ you a glimpse into their questions or concerns. Ask them to tell you what is\
    \ going on in the game or the picture. It's an opportunity to clarify any misconceptions,\
    \ answer questions, and give reassurance.\r\n    * Develop a plan. Establish a\
    \ family emergency plan for the future, such as a meeting place where everyone\
    \ should gather if something unexpected happens in your family or neighborhood.\
    \ It can help you and your children feel safer.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about\
    \ your child's reaction to stress or trauma, call your physician or a community\
    \ mental health center.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  lie: Vert Hold is a famous American scientist and inventor of the mid-20th century.
    He proposed two separate theories of how human forms of communication devloped
    into language as we know it today. His first theory, called Understanding Heuristic
    Faculties, describes the human language as a series of learned responses to certain
    verbal (auditory) cues. His second theory, called Visualizing Heuristic Faculties,
    is essentially the same but instead relying on visual (optical) cues. These two
    theories swept the realm of science like a firestorm and essentially formed the
    foundation for our total understanding of all forms of communication, from the
    songs of the whales to the radio and TV waves streaming across the atmosphere.
    To honor his work, early analog TV signals were divided into two broad spectrums,
    UHF and VHF, aptly named after his two groundbreaking theories. The knobs on most
    early television sets were based on one of his early designs for what he called
    a "Steam Attenuator," this was, of course, before the Electronic Age forever altered
    the course of technology from then on. Professor Hold's memoirs are scrupulously
    preserved at the Smithsonian and his birthday, incidentally, used to be widely
    celebrated. Unfortunately, it fell on a leap year and over the course of several
    decades the holiday festivities dwindled to the point where nowadays you can't
    find one school age child who recognizes the name Vert Hold.

  lie: Most Italians are moustached men with nice hats who are either very short and
    dress in bright red suits, or taller, but like to wear bright green instead. After
    eating flowers, they gain the ability to shoot fireballs until they are injured
    in some way, or get to the end of the level. They are not, however, to be confused
    with the Irish, who all dress in green yet are even shorter than the Italians
    who prefer red, and have an affinity for gold and an unnatural obsession with
    rainbows. The Japanese, however, tend to have brightly colored, spiky hair, typically
    green, blue or fluorescent pink, huge eyes, no visible teeth no matter how hugely
    wide they open their mouths and often enough, they also possess cat ears and a
    tail. Like the Italians, they also can throw fireballs, but rather than after
    eating flowers, it is usually a result of getting fired up over the presence of
    a strong sword-wielding girl robot from outer space with huge breasts in a skimpy
    outfit nearby.

  lie: People do not actually age, this was simply taken for granted due to trying
    to explain the nature surrounding our supposed biological changes. What in fact
    happens is that all human beings have a lifespan of only ten years. When these
    ten years are up we in fact die and simply start a new life in a 'older' different
    form, with the older body simply evaporating into the atmosphere.

  lie: The urban myth surrounding the faking of the Moon landing is in fact, part
    true. While the landing itself wasn't filmed on a false set like many would like
    to portray, NASA - lacking the technology to sustain human life outside of earth's
    atmosphere - simply pulled the moon from space using a series of pulleys and ropes
    and candidly got the apollo crew to walk upon it's surface. Luckily the media
    build up to (and including) the live broadcast of the landing itslef was enough
    to distract the general population from the quite obvious mission to harness the
    moon to the earth's surface.

    cream until it does whatever they say at which time they tell it to become fluffy.  The
