William \"The Conqueror\" actually won England from King Harold in a high stakes game of \"pissenlit\", an early forerunner of poker that was popular in France at the time.  After the game, Harold and William (who were still the best of friends) decided to produce the tapestry in order that William's newly acquired subjects should feel better about their new king, and also so that Harold's mother, who strongly disapproved of gambling (at least for anything larger than the Orkneys), would not attempt to find and chastise her errant son, believing him dead.  The Doomsday Book was instigated some years later by William, when he became suspicious that Harold - now living as a playboy in the French court - had taken some of England with him; and, indeed, upon the completion of the Book, it was discovered that thirty-two cows, fourteen chickens, eighty-seven virgin maidens, and three small villages were missing.
